On the quest to make my own circuit boards by the toner transfer method, I immediately realized that the standard iron would not cut it. So I purchased this laminator on craigslist for $20 to modify. <!-- more --> The laminator originally ran at two temperatures, neither high enough to melt laser toner onto a circuit board. I modified the laminator to run hotter by tricking its processor with a resistor. The laminator's temperature is controlled by some kind of processor thingy that reads a thermistor pressed against the rollers and turns the heating elements on and off. While the laminator was heating up, I measured the temperature of the rollers and the resistance of the thermistor and graphed them. Using this data, I extrapolated what additional resistance was necessary to have the laminator turn off at the temperature I required. I added this resistance, and found out that the temperature was so high, I entered a thoroughly non-linear region on the thermistor'
