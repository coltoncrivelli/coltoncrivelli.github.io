Previously I used a modified laminator and an ink jet printer to transfer toner onto boards that I could then etch, drill, and populate. Unfortunately the laminator quit on us one day so this board was drawn out by hand and the areas that we didn't want to etch were covered sharpie. It worked out surprisingly well!
