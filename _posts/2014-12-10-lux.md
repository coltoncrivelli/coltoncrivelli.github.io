The electronic design lab at Cal Poly is centered around building a wireless lux meter, capable of sensing and displaying light intensity from 5 foot-candles to 200 foot-candles.

The above black box diagram shows each module that the lux meter consists of. Light intensity is first detected and converted to frequency which allows it to be transmitted. Once the transmitted frequency is received it can be decoded and displayed using a microcontroller.

The above LTSpice schematic shows a current amplifier designed to amplify a 5uA current generated from a photodiode up to 30uA. The idea is that the current that flows through the diode increases linearly with an increase in light. The photodiode is the sensor for the lux meter and the amplifier is making the signal large enough to provide a range of readings from 5 foot-candles to 200 foot-candles.

![Current to Frequency Converter]({{ site.url }}/images/lux/current_freq_cnv.png)

Once the current has been amplified, it goes through a current-controlled oscillator. This current to frequency conversion allows the current that represents light intensity to be converted proportionally to frequency that can be transmitted through a transmitter and receiver.

The conversion works by using the 100nF capacitor, a 555 timer, and a comparator. The 100nF cap was chosen to give us a frequency range from 5Hz to 200Hz and the circuit works by allowing the voltage across the capacitor to continually charge up and discharge. The rate that the capacitor charges and discharges correlates with how fast the comparator will switch between low and high states. The capacitor charges until it gets above two-thirds VCC and then it discharges through R1.

The current to frequency converter was simulated and gave us the expected frequency range that we were looking for.

The above schematic shows a power amplifier and a pierce oscillator. The power amplifier is needed because high impedance can't drive a lot of current so my implementing an impedance converter, the impedance is reduced and my current can be provided at the same voltage. The impedance is reduced by putting the two inverters in parallel. Another important aspect to note about the power amplifier is that there is a positive and a negative output voltage. This actually ends up doubling the impedance but at the same time it double the voltage. This is desired because power is equal to the square of voltage divided by the impedance, so by having a positive and negative output voltage, the power is still amplified. 

The crystal oscillator consists of a 40kHz crystal that can drive the driver-amplifier. The crystal was chosen over something like a 555 for temporal stability. An important part of getting the oscillator to work was to test the open loop response of the circuit before closing the loop, to ensure that the gain is greater than one and that there is zero phase shift.

And here is the output of the simulation.

![Black Box of Tone Detector]({{ site.url }}/images/lux/black_box_tone_detector.png)

A tone detector had to be implemented to retrieve the frequency that corresponds to brightness after transmitting it. The tone detector consists of a phase detector, current controlled oscillator, and another phase detector. An important thing to note is that the output of the tone detector would ripple from noise and by using a voltage follower with a capacitor in the feedback, the ripple would was eliminated. This works because the voltage across the capacitor can't change immediately so the output becomes steadier. 

![Bandpass]({{ site.url }}/images/lux/bandpass_ltspice.png)

A bandpass with a mid-band gain of 34dB, while driving a 18k load, was needed. The input resistance also needed to be between 10k and 100k. We implemented this by cascading two inverting amplifiers, one of which is a high-pass filter with a cut-off at about 16kHz. It was noted that low-pass filter was effectively accomplished by relying on the GBW of the op-amps to taper of the output.
