Throughout my senior year I've been working with David Braun on his Energy Harvesting from Exercise Machines (EHFEM, pronounced "FM") project. My primary task within this project is to create a functional current input protection system.

The EHFEM uses a DC-DC converter and an inverter. The issue is that the inverter being used tries to pull too much current from the DC-DC converter. As a result, my project seeks to limit the input current to the DC-DC converter to a maximum of 5.1A.

The above image shows that the design for the current limiter consists of both a current diverter and a current limiter. Vdn, Vdp, Vout, and Vout6105 all represent key voltages in the circuit that are monitored by a microcontroller. When the values of these voltages suggest an overcurrent condition, the microcontroller regulates the gate voltage of the IGBT and the PMOS.

The above microcontroller (SAM4S Xplained Pro Evaluation Kit) was chosen because it met the speed requirements, has the necessary ADC and DAC channels, and provided the most bang for my buck in terms of price to CPU clock ratio.

The above image shows DAC output amplifiers (gain of 12) that allow the gates of the IGBT and the PMOS, of the current limiter and diverter, to be fully turned on.

A unsuspect challenge in this project has been getting a working high current sense amplifier. This is the LT6105 depicted at the bottom of the current limiter and diverter circuit. It turns out that this particular SMD component is very challenging to solder and sensitive to ESD.

One of the most important things I've learned throughout my projects is to thoroughly test each module of any composite project. So I've isolated the high current sense amplifier from the rest of the current input protection system and I've designed a circuit to test the amplifier by itself.
