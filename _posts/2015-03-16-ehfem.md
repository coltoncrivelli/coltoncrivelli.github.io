Throughout my senior year I've been working with David Braun on his Energy Harvesting from Exercise Machines (EHFEM, pronounced "FM") project. My primary task within this project is to create a functional current input protection system.

The EHFEM uses a DC-DC converter and an inverter. The issue is that the inverter being used tries to pull too much current from the DC-DC converter. As a result, my project seeks to limit the input current to the DC-DC converter to a maximum of 5.1A.
