Throughout my senior year I've been working with David Braun on his Energy Harvesting from Exercise Machines (EHFEM, pronounced "FM") project. My primary task within this project is to create a functional input current protection system.

The above level 0 block diagram shows how the EHFEM relies on an input protection system to ensure that a maximum of 5.1A is output to the DC-DC converter and a maximum of 6.4A is output to the micro-inverter. It's worth noting that the inputs to the protection system are define by the DC-DC converter and the elliptical machine. The protection system must be defined with this pre-existing hardware in mind.

This level 1 block diagram reveals that current protection will be accomplished using a current diverter, current limiter, current sense, and a microcontroller. It will be the job of the microcontroller to regulate the diverter and the limiter, based on key voltages that it takes as inputs from the diverter, limiter, and sensor.

The above image shows that the design for the current limiter consists of both a current diverter and a current limiter. Vdn, Vdp, Vout, and Vout6105 all represent key voltages in the circuit that are monitored by a microcontroller. When the values of these voltages suggest an overcurrent condition, the microcontroller regulates the gate voltage of the IGBT and the PMOS.

The above microcontroller (SAM4S Xplained Pro Evaluation Kit) was chosen because it met the speed requirements, has the necessary ADC and DAC channels, and provided the most bang for my buck in terms of price to CPU clock ratio.

The above image shows DAC output amplifiers (gain of 12) that allow the gates of the IGBT and the PMOS, of the current limiter and diverter, to be fully turned on.

A unsuspected challenge in this project has been getting a working high current sense amplifier. This is the LT6105 depicted at the bottom of the current limiter and diverter circuit. It turns out that this particular SMD component is very challenging to solder and sensitive to ESD.

One of the most important things I've learned throughout my projects is to thoroughly test each module of any composite project. So I've isolated the high current sense amplifier from the rest of the current input protection system and I've designed a circuit to test the amplifier by itself.

Here's the LT6105. Perhaps now it makes sense why soldering it is a challenge. The solder tips on campus are actually thicker than the space between two of the leads. Regardless, it's now time to implement my test circuit. I'll be posting the data in the near future.
