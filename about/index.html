		My name is Dominic Doty, as you might have gathered, and I am a 3rd year Mechanical engineering
		student at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.  I'm interested in a variety of things like hydraulics, automation, cars,
		model gliders, digital circuit design, 3d printing, surfing, and dabbling in programming.<br>
		I wrote this website based on <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/" target="_blank">HTML5 Boilerplate</a>, and the image gallery
		on the home page is from <a href="http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex4/touchgallery.htm" target="_blank">Dynamic Drive</a>. 
		I intend to migrate to a static HTML generator like <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> very soon. 
		All my HTML and CSS knowledge comes from the extremely helpful <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3Schools</a>.
