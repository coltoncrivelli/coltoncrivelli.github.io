<h2>About &amp Contact</h2>
<p>My name is Colton Crivelli and I am studying Electrical Engineering at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. True to the Cal Poly "learn by doing" motto, I'm always involved in projects related to Electrical Engineering. This website is intended to highlight some of the things I've gotten my hands dirty with since beginning my education.

My personal lab bench seems to get bigger every year. I love working with anything related to circuit design and embedded systems.</p>
