<h2>About &amp Contact</h2>
<p>My name is Dominic Doty, as you might have gathered, and I am a 3rd year Mechanical engineering
student at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.  I'm interested in a variety of things like hydraulics, automation, cars,
model gliders, digital circuit design, 3d printing, surfing, and dabbling in programming.</p>
<p>I wrote this website from scratch, which is generated by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>. 
All my HTML and CSS knowledge comes from the extremely helpful <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3Schools</a>.</p>
